As can be seen in Map II, the Uzbek population tends to cluster near the major northern urban centers, To the north, Uzbeks trail off beyond the edges of the steppe zone; to the east, a certain number can be found in Badakhshan alongside mountain Tajiks (Kushkeki 1926); to the south, they extend into the foothill zone stretching from below Maimana to Samangan, and in Saripul the Tappers assess the Uzbek component at 40 percent of the population (1974: p.c.); in the west, Uzbeks dwindle out between Qaisar and Bala Murghab in the Paropamisus zone. </P><P>
Estimates of the number of Uzbeks in Afghanistan vary widely. Perhaps the figure of one million given in the Soviet survey of Afghanistan is most acceptable (Aslanov 1969: 72); at any rate, it is clear that a fairly large population is involved for a country so sparsely settled as Afghanistan. </P><P>
The Uzbeks, like the Tajiks, have no common place of origin or time of appearance on the Turkestani scene. Soviet scholars, particularly B. Kh. Karmysheva (1964), have inquired deeply into the ethnic composition of the southern areas of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and their findings probably hold good for northern Afghanistan. According to Karmysheva (1964:98), there are basically two major groups of Uzbeks in the area: (1) the vast majority (about 75 percent), consisting of Uzbeks whose origin can be traced to the Dasht-i Kipchak (in the present Kazakh steppe) and who arrived in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, mostly during the large-scale Uzbek invasion led by Sheibani Khan in the early sixteenth century; and (2) a smaller group of Uzbeks called T¸rk (10 percent), whose arrival considerably predates that of the Dasht-i Kipchak Uzbeks and who were already cultivators when the latter appeared on the scene. To these two groups can be added other minor components, principally the rather mysterious group called the Chagatai Uzbeks (2.6 percent), corresponding roughly to the Chagatai Tajiks (the origin of both is obscure, and a full discussion of the term Chagatai, though fascinating, lies beyond the scope of the present study). Karmysheva is able to supply a clear picture of the settlement pattern of these groups, placing the T¸rk in hills above the Chagatai and Dasht-i Kipchak Uzbeks, but below the mountain Tajiks (1964: 98). She also points out the presence of tiny splinter groups of Uzbeks whose background is shrouded in historical confusion.</P><P>
This interesting information notwithstanding, we are still in the dark as to the exact relationship existing between the Uzbeks (and for that matter, the Tajiks) of Afghanistan and their relatives in Transoxania. The general breakdown given by Karmysheva may well be valid in both areas, but recent history has provided a considerable barrier to the continued sharing of culture by these groups, in the form of a political frontier. G. F. Debets, a Soviet anthropologist, recently spent considerable time surveying the peoples of Afghanistan, and he offers this caveat: "Notwithstanding the common origin of the Uzbeks living to the north and south of the Amu-Darya, it is completely obvious that the political boundary introduced along this river as early as the eighteenth century has played a definite ethnographic role" (1967: 88). Thus the common cultural heritage of the Uzbeks has been broken, and we shall see in later chapters how this is reflected in differences between the music culture of northern Afghanistan and that of Soviet Central Asia. Debets also notes that the Afghan Uzbeks are quite vague about their tribal identity, though some of them identify themselves as Chagatai Uzbeks (1967: 88). This indicates that they have been cut off from the bulk of Uzbeks in southern Uzbekistan, who have strong tribal orientations. It seems likely, however, that the underlying distinctions made by Karmysheva probably held true for Afghan Turkestan in the past. Thus, for example, Vambery (1970:268) observed ". . . 200 tents of the Uzbeks, from the tribes of Kungrat and Nayman" near the Afghan border at Kerki in 1863, indicating that tent residence, mobility, and easy identification of constituent tribes were standard parts of Uzbek life a century ago. </P><P>
Most of the Uzbeks of Afghan Turkestan are settled and live in towns or villages, but up until quite recently ‚the late nineteenth century‚ there was a considerable body of seminomadic Uzbeks in Turkestan. It was largely because of the pressure of incoming Pashtun nomads (see below), who preempted much of the favorable grazing land, that the Uzbeks turned to agriculture and town life. </P><P>
Karmysheva does not mention, for obvious reasons, one important group of Afghan Uzbeks: the ÈmigrÈs of the early twentieth century who crossed the border during the Basmachi rebellion against Soviet power in the 1920s and 1930s. Considerable numbers of these mohajerin ("refugees"), as they are called, live in Kataghan, but some of them can be found in Turkestani towns such as Andkhoi and Mazar-i Sharif. They tend to have urban rather than peasant or seminomadic origins, and they are still sharply defined within the Afghan Uzbek community. </P>
