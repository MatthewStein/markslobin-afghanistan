 <P class="head1">Women's Music</p>
<P>
Across the North two instruments are the principal available sound producers for women. These are the tambourine (doira) and the jew's harp (chang). As far as I know, among none of the ethnic groups in the region is it customary for women to play any of the numerous varieties of plucked and bowed lutes (fiddles). On the other hand, men are widely allowed to play both the tambourine and jew's harp. The jew's harp is also played by children; most northerners are likely to respond "women and children" when asked, "Who plays the chang?" It is only when pressed that they will admit that men can also perform on the jew's harp. This attitude was documented early in the 19505 by J. C. Lubtschansky. In his recordings of that period he includes a fine specimen of Uzbek jew's harp play, performed by a man, and he notes: "The man playing it on our request felt very much ashamed, for, said he, 'Only women and children play the chang' " (1969: 2) .Nevertheless, Lubtschansky's Uzbek displayed a high degree of skill on the chang, indicating that men do indeed practice the instrument. The nominal restriction of the jew's harp to women and youths is found in Soviet Central Asia among Tajiks, Kazakhs, and Kirghiz (Vertkov 1963: 129, 131, 133) . 
</P><P>The doira is less a matter of special northern development than is the chang, since tambourines of varying size and description are played by women all across the Near East, often under the name doira or daf (the latter is a term also found in Afghanistan, principally in Badakhshan) . A particular local feature uniting the North's use of the doira, however , is the manufacture of the instrument by Gypsy artisans. Tambourines are made by Gypsies in locales as far apart as Aqcha ( Turkestan ) , Khanabad ( Kataghan ) , and the Koh-i Daman (just north of Kabul) . 
</P><P>The lesson learned from separate examination of the two women's instruments- tambourine and jew's harp- is that one of two major factors can be at work in determining the place of any shared cultural or musical trait within the general matrix of the North: either the trait emerges as a result of local ethnic accommodation, sometimes on a microgeographic scale, as in the case of the adoption of the jew's harp by groups surrounding the Tajiks, or the trait may be part of an extensive Near Eastern-Islamic network in which northern Afghanistan figures only as a peripheral zone. 
</P><P>The women's repertoire is far less of a shared item than the instrumentarium. Although data for women of various ethnic groups is extremely limited at present, it seems that by and large each group commands its own repertoire of women's songs, with certain exceptions to be discussed presently. This is bound to be the case, because of the high degree of women's isolation within the household walls among the sedentary population. For example, Sakata's writing on Hazaras of Central Afghanistan (1968:35) contrasts men's familiarity with standard Afghan Persian (Dari) with women's reliance on the Hazara dialect (Hazaragi): "In most cases, Hazara men know and use Dari as well as Hazaragi, thus many of their songs are in Dari. ...The women's songs, on the other hand, are more strictly in Hazaragi, since they are less exposed to other peoples and cultures." It seems likely that research in the North would reveal a similar pattern. The principal exceptions to the pattern are professional women singers, who must cater to more than one ethnic group. Thus Zulaikha and Gulandam of Andkhoi sing wedding songs with quatrains in both Uzbek and Persian; they also sings songs that are purely in Uzbek ( their native language) and related to Transoxanian Uzbek repertoires ( Lyrichord LIST 7231) . 
</P><P>However, despite the differences preserved through women's isolation, common features mark women's songs across the North. One factor influencing commonality is, once again, the radio. The women's wedding song Asta bero, probably stemming originally from a Kabul Pashtun-Tajik milieu, has been popularized by the radio in many different versions -even in an arrangement by male amateurs with Western instruments. The radio has played only a minor role in promoting a joint musical storehouse for women, however. More potent as a unifier is the traditiQnal assignment of two basic musical roles to women: singing lullabies and singing songs at domestic festivities, principally weddings. Unfortunately, scarcely any lullabies have been recorded in the North, so assessment of the nature and scope of the repertoire must await further research. Sakata's (1968) findings among the Hazaras of Central Afghanistan indicates that lullabies form an interesting and extensive body of women's songs. As noted earlier, celebrations such as weddings serve as important outlets for women and may be prolonged for their enjoyment; thus wedding songs form a large part of women's total musical activity. According to Surkhi, Turkmen women sing only at weddings. The Uzbek repertoire seems particularly rich in wedding songs, and Tajiks and sedentary Pashtuns sing a series of songs for different segments of the wedding ceremony. Beyond the basic unity of lullabies and wedding songs, the ethnic groups once again break into separate traditions for women. 

</P><P class="head1">The Music of Kabul and the Mashreqi 

</P><P>One of the important components of the shared music culture is the body of repertoire and instruments stemming from the area of Kabul and eastern Afghanistan (Mashreqi).In its broadest geographical sense, this region could be considered the concentrated arena of Pashtun urban music, which has strong folk song roots. The language and materials drawn upon cover nearly the whole of Pashtun country, from Kandahar to Peshawar (Pakistan), but the results are distilled in a roughly triangular region embracing the Logar Valley south of Kabul, Kabul itself, and Lagman and Jalalabad in the east. This rich storehouse of Pashtun rural ( village and nomadic) and urban poetry and music has been little studied save in Hoerburger's ( 1969) brief survey and in the periodic collections of Pashtun folk poetry issued by the Pashto Tolana (Pashto Academy) of Kabul. Even the dense musical life of Kabul has scarcely been discussed, and the data from Radio Afghanistan offered in the present study are hardly typical. Thus it is impossible to give a well-rounded picture of the fertile Pashtun musical soil, whose abundant fruit is one of the principal cultural exports of the Kabul-Mashreqi area to the North. 
</P><P>Let us begin with the musical instruments, about which we are fairly well informed, though we are still far from having a definitive statement of their origin, use, and diffusion. Four instruments stand out as exports from Kabul-Mashreqi: two lute types (the tanbur and robab), a drum (the tabla), and the harmonium. The latter two are direct imports from India. The tabla is the standard North Indian set of two drums, and all the tablas in Afghanistan are of Indian origin. Likewise, the harmonium is never locally made. This diminutive relative of the organ was brought to India long ago by European missionaries and used as a tool in spreading Christianity. Once in India, it was soon adopted as a handy accompaniment for native art music, and it was in this guise that the harmonium reached Afghanistan, where it was termed armonia. Its use has spread as a result of the radio broadcasts, since it serves as accompaniment to the music of the ustads. Confined until recently to the Kabul-Mashreqi area, the armonia has diffused rapidly through the countryside and is prized among provincial aficionados of radio music. The great advantage of the armonia is that nearly anyone can pick out a tune on its keyboard, or at least hold down a couple of drone pitches and fake an accompaniment to a song. The ease of performance contrasts markedly to the skill needed to play any of the lute or fiddle types alternately available to amateurs. 
</P><P>The importance of the skill necessary for passable play is clear in the case of the tabla, which is by no means as widespread as the harmonium. The complicated drumming technique limits the use of the tabla to a handful of trained performers, and it is played in the North only in touring bands from the Kabul-Mashreqi area and in the ensembles of local musicians who have received special training from Kabul-Mashreqi performers. The tabla seems most indispensable in the Logar Valley style of dance music, the staple accompaniment to the performance of dancing boys. Although on most other occasions the goblet-shaped zirbaghali, or any large tin can, may substitute for the recondite tabla. I have never seen it used for this bachabazi dancing. It should be noted that few if any Afghan tabla players are so advanced in technical mastery as to be capable of the virtuoso performances offered by North Indian drummers. The tabla is generally used only for basic rhythmic patterns typical of zirbaghali drumming, with the possible exception of certain gliding rolls easily played on the tabla; even in the latter case, however, one can find virtuoso zirbaghali players (Malang Nejrowi, for example) who can match or better Afghan tabla performance. Thus, in the case of the tabla it is the basic sound quality and the repertoire that cause its appearance outside of its basic area rather than the actual musical possibilities of the instrument, which remain largely unexploited by its players. 
</P><P>The case of the tanbur and robab lutes is quite different in most respects, principally in offering musical qualities unavailable in the North. The two lute types are distinctive in construction, playing style, and timbre, and both appear to be among the tiny group of instruments that can probably be said to have originated in Afghanistan. Let us take the tanbur first. None of the lute types of North India, Transoxania, or Iran is constructed precisely like the tanbur. A tantalizingly similar instrument, called setar, is found among the Tajiks of Tajikistan, but the differences between the setar and tanbur are basic enough to preclude a direct connection. The earliest attested date for the existence of the tanbur is the year 1300 of the Persian calendar (A.D. 1821), the date carved on an old tanbur brought to me by Baba Naim of Kabul for inspection. The maker's name was also inscribed clearly and appeared antique, and I have no reason to doubt the instrument's authenticity. Thus it is clear that the tanbur is not a recent invention, and there is substantiation for the statements of older musicians that as far back as they could recall there had always been a tanbur in Afghanistan. Furthermore, the 1821 instrument is almost exactly the size and shape of the current tanbur.
</P><P>The national focus of tanbur construction and performance is the Kabul-Mashreqi area, but inquiries among Kabul tanbur makers yielded no positive results in pinning down the lute's origin any further. In the North, Mazar-i Sharif is the center of tanbur making and playing. Since both performers and instrument makers state that "whatever Kabul had, Mazar always had," it is reasonable to assume that the tanbur came north along with many other goods from Kabul. Outside of Mazar, this long-necked lute rarely appears, though its spread seems to have increased in the past few years. Confirming the theory of a spread from Kabul is the content of the tanbur repertoire in the North, which consists largely of Kabul-Mashreqi popular music. There is little, if any, purely instrumental music for the tanbur; it is almost always used as accompaniment (dambura) dance tunes will be used. Here too, though, the repertoire often consists of songs arranged for instrumental use with little alteration or ornamentation. The chief attraction of the tanbur's sound is its metallic twang, produced by using a metal plectrum on the instrument's multitude of melodic and sympathetic wire strings. This sound quality is markedly different from the basic timbre of the dambura, the favorite local lute type, which features finger plucking and strumming on nylon strings combined with knocks on the lid. 
</P><P>The Kabul-Mashreqi robab also offers a special sound. This distinctively shaped instrument is the only Afghan short-necked lute, and save for the rare Pamir robab, it is the only lute type played with a wooden (or bone) plectrum. It is unique in appearance and timbre, as well as in its playing style, which features rapid repeated-note strokes and sharp breaks in sound that contrast sharply with the continuous sound of the dambura and ghichak. In the North, the tanbur and robab do not merely represent the appearance of a different music subculture, as does the tabla, but they also contribute a very real acoustic presence whose sound values differ sharply from those of the local music. 
</P><P>The repertoire of all the instruments just discussed consists primarily of Kabul-Mashreqi urban music, with some bending towards the regional northern style if audience demand warrants. The presence of at least the tanbur in pre-radio days in the North testifies to old musical links between that region and the Kabul-Mashreqi area. However, the recent widespread appearance of the harmonium again indicates the explosive nature of the radio impact, which diffused the use of an instrument new to the North within a comparatively short time. 
</P><P>The incursion of Kabul-Mashreqi music goes beyond its association with the instruments just discussed. Perhaps the farthest-reaching impact of the style has been in its adoption by the traditional sowqi performers who use the indigenous instruments of the North (dambura and ghichak). In this case, it is almost entirely the music broadcast by Radio Afghanistan that is involved rather than folk music or non-broadcast repertoires of the Kabul-Mashreqi area. Radio music has become one of the prime components of the shared culture in the heart of the public music arena, teahouse performance, as well as in the private amateur playing of nonprofessionals or gharibi-showqis across the North. In this eclectic, improvised style, the teahouse dambura player pulls in any and all types of music he knows, varying the length and content of the performance to his own and the audience's taste. Radio songs have become one of the assumed and integral parts of such pieces. Also of interest is the predominance of radio songs among people who sing in the street. Careful listening in any northern town will reveal that very few men sing while working or passing the time of day, and that of those who do, the majority are singing radio music; most important, in nearly all cases of children singing to themselves, radio music is being sung. For the younger generation the radio plays the main role in forming musical taste and repertoire; clearly the future belongs to the radio. The radio style penetrates to the women's quarters as well. Eagerly taping wedding entertainment in Faizabad, to the consternation of the women performers ( though egged on by male spectators) , I found that I was recording merely a local variant of a standard radio favorite, Anar. anar.
