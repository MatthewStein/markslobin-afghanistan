<P class="head1">THE TURKMENS, from <U><I>Music in the Culture of Northern Afghanistan</I></U>, Page 12 - 14</P>
<span class="text">
<P>The Turkmens are the only people of the North who also live in the two adjoining countries, the USSR and Iran. Estimates of the number of Turkmens in Afghanistan vary as widely as those for Uzbeks. Schurmann (1961: 86) has collected the Russian guesses as follows: Aristov at 50,000; Reisner at 200,000; Reiser at 4 percent of the population of Afghanistan; and Bochkarev at 380,000, or 3 percent. Schurmann himself gives "a minimum Turkmen population in Afghanistan of 200,000 or more." The most recent Soviet figure, 400,000 (Aslanov 1969: 75), is probably as accurate as any. 
</P><P>The Turkmens are concentrated in a thin strip of territory extending no more than about fifty kilometers south of the Soviet border, except in the Herat area in the extreme west. This strip runs nearly the entire length of northern Afghanistan, from Herat to eastern Kataghan. Outside of this zone of settlement, some Turkmens can be found in Kabul, where they are prominent in the carpet industry. There seem to be few, if any, Turkmens in Badakhshan. 
</P><P>The Turkmens of Turkestan and Kataghan are largely of the Ersari and Alieli tribes. There are some Salor and Teke Turkmens in the Herat area, along with scattered representatives of other tribes. Though the vast majority of Afghan Turkmens are recent immigrants, who came across the Soviet border in the years roughly from 1915 to 1940, chronicles of the eighteenth and even seventeenth centuries indicate the presence of large groups of Turkmens in the Andkhoi-Aqcha sector of Afghan Turkestan, according to the Soviet scholar Yu. E. Bregel, who has compiled a valuable ethnic map of southern Turkmenistan for both the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (1959: 14). His chart shows first Imreli and then both Afshar and Jalair Turkmens in the area mentioned. Nineteenth-century travelers often remarked on the presence of Turkmens in the general area of  Balkh, which for them included land as far west as Andkhoi. Vambery, for example, spoke of the Ersari as occupying the territory between Charjau, now in the Turkmen SSR, and  Balkh, while he located the Alieli between Andkhoi and Merv (1970:274). His judgment of the Turkmens is rather interesting, contrasting as it does with the common nineteenth-century view of the Turkmens as unscrupulous marauders and slave traders: "Turkmens, though predatory and anarchic in structure, have fewer thieves, murderers and breaches of justice and morals than all the other Islamic peoples" (1873:274). 
</P><P>Afghan Turkmens concede that there were relatively few of their people in Afghanistan before the first quarter of the twentieth century. Observation will bear out the impression that the most prominent and prosperous Turkmens are those who came during that time. The powerful leading family of the village of Qizilayaq, for example, which exercises great influence on Afghan Turkmens through religious authority, crossed the border in 1916, because of the growing troubles in their homeland. 
</P><P>Turkmens live in qishlaqs (villages) surrounding a local market center that serves as the major point of contact with the outside world. Apparently, Turkmens also resided outside city walls a century ago; Ferrier (1860), in his survey of northern towns, mentioned only a majority Uzbek and minority Tajik population in Maimana, Andkhoi, Shiberghan, and Aqcha. Most Turkmen houses are built with the gumbat, or domed roof, construction that is found in various areas of the Near East and is particularly popular in Northern Afghanistan. There do not seem to be any purely nomadic Turkmens in Afghanistan and few, if any, seminomads. 
</P><P>The Turkmens do not make good ethnic mixers. They tend to remain aloof from their neighbors, even from fellow Turks like the Uzbeks, though Schurmann notes "much more intermingling between Turkmens and Uzbeks" at the Turkestani end of Turkmen habitation than between Turkmens and Aimaqs towards the Badghisat end (1961: 95). One can indeed witness a certain amount of adaptation by Turkmens to Uzbek life-styles in the North, and this in turn is related to the Uzbeks' acculturation to Tajik norms mentioned earlier. This role of Uzbeks as cultural middlemen for other Turks has been documented for various areas of Central Asia, and as long ago as 1865 Vambery observed that in the Ferghana Valley area Kirghiz, Kipchak, and Kalmucks assimilated to Uzbeks "due to a certain prestige of breeding and bon ton of the Uzbeks, longer established in Turkestan" (1970:432). 
</P><P>For the most part, the Turkmens are economically well established in Afghanistan, thanks to the enormous importance to the Afghan economy of the carpets (of the "Afghan" and "Bokhara" varieties) woven by Turkmen women and of the karakul sheep, which the Turkmens brought to Afghanistan by the millions. Rugs and skins form the two largest export items in Afghanistan. Much of the prosperity resulting from this trade falls into the hands of a small upper class of Turkmens, but Turkmens in general are fairly well off by Afghan standards. This judgment, of course, depends greatly on two principal factors: favorable sale abroad for Turkmen skins and carpets and favorable weather for livestock breeding. The disastrous drought and subsequent severe winter and flooding of 1970-72 had calamitous effects on Turkmen livestock holdings. Estimates of losses for karakul sheep herds tended to run at about 75 to 80 percent, with some villagers facing starvation. 
</P><P>Settled now in villages and adjusting somewhat to the Uzbek-Tajik model of village life, the Turkmens today are beginning to forget their old tribal ways and are participating in Afghan social and political life. G. F. Debets, who noted the differences between Afghan and Uzbekistani Uzbeks mentioned above, has this comment on the Turkmens: "The Afghan Turkmens find themselves in approximately the same position vis-ý-vis the Turkmens of Turkmenia as the Afghan Uzbeks to the Uzbeks of Uzbekistan" (1967:88). 
</P><P>Some of the difference Debets notes, however, may well be ascribed to tribal variations among the Turkmens. The Ersari, for instance, who form the bulk of northern Afghan Turkmens, have long been distinct from other Turkmen tribes, as noted by Vambery: </P><blockquote>
The Ersari Turkomans, who only migrated hither from Manghishlak 200 years ago, have retained very little of the national characteristics of the Turkomans. They may be styled only semi-nomads, the greater part cultivating the land, and the remainder, still exclusively pastoral, having lost with their savage character all the primitive virtues of their kindred tribe. (1970:272) 
</blockquote><P>Vambery's value judgment regarding "primitive virtues" aside, his remarks are useful evidence for associating the Ersari with a semi- nomadic or totally agricultural way of life well before they arrived in Afghan Turkestan in large numbers after the October Revolution. </P>
