<P>The master musicians of the North (not to be confused with the ustad "masters" of the radio) are all showqi; that is, they have arrived at their positions through informal training and encouragement, and they cling to the showqi title tenaciously to avoid identification with the kespi  (hereditary) musicians. For example, one of the best-known singers of Badakhshan introduced himself to me as Karim Showqi Darwazi, giving his status (showqi) before his place of origin (the Darwaz region of Badakhshan); others in the North referred to him as Karim Darwazi, whereas at Radio Afghanistan he was called simply Karim Badakhshi ("from Badakhshan"), a name giving only his broadest point of origin. 
Musicians insist on the showqi label for another reason as well. The state of liveliness implied by the term is a necessary adjunct of their fulfilling of the musician's role. The leading musician of Aqcha, Aq Pishak, uses a sobriquet meaning "white cat," apparently an allusion to his abilities as a maskharabaz, or comedian, in which role he makes humorous animal noises ( examples are recorded on Anthology AST 4001) and generally plays the clown. Such talents can be useful for musicians, though by no means all performers can or do indulge in these professional tricks. It is, however, such indications of liveliness that lead listeners to say appreciatively, U besiar showqist ("He's very showqi") . Master musicians of this category tend to be itinerant, though there are notable exceptions such as Aq Pishak. Once firmly entrenched in the role of professional, they make their living following the teahouse route from town to town, staying in a community as long as there are enough teahouse contracts and party jobs to play. The widest-ranging tour I know of was that of Baz Gul Badakhshi in 1968; his home town is Keshm, westernmost city of Badakhshan, and I had accounts of him from as far away as Saripul in south-central Turkestan, seven bus or truck stops removed from Keshm. These wandering minstrels cross-pollinate the musical environment, keeping whole species of music alive, and are thus an integral component of the shared music culture of the North. </P><P>
The work tends to be seasonal, and high points occur at various times of the year. The Nowruz (New Year's) season, which begins at the vernal equinox around March 21 brings forty days of celebra- tions, and music and dance occur much more openly in towns during this festival than at any other time of year, save for the Jeshen holiday, a week-Iong festival in late August, commemorating Afghanistan's independence from British influence in 1919. Harvest time is another peak season for musicians. In his calendar of activities for the Tasqurgan region, Centlivres (1970: Plate XLIlb) gives the months of Sombola, Mizan, and Aqrab (August 23 to November 21) as the "saison des affaires, saison des mariages." On the other hand, the summer is definitelv a slack season, for temperatures often rise to the 11Oƒ F mark in Turkestan and Kataghan, and energy is conserved. Winter may be intermittently good to musicians if the rich landowners (bais) decide to sponsor parties to accompany matches of buzkashi, the famed horsemanship contest of Turkestan. Thus by painstakingly following the course of party and teahouse, the itinerant musician can eke out a living, saving money from the fat seasons for the lean months. Financially, a musician can do at least as well as the ordinary worker in the North, and probably a good deal better, since in the course of two nights' work he can earn as much as a casual laborer does in a month: about 600 afghanis, or $7.50. The attitude of the showqi professional is best summed up in the story surrounding Baba Qeran's adoption of his sobriquet. Baba Qeran, who was approximately eighty years old in 1968, is considered the dean of the showqis. While Baba simply is an honorific applied to old men, qeran is a unit of currency (1/2 afghani, small change) .According to some, in his youth the future Baba Qeran was quite popular as an amateur performer, but soon turned into a professional: when asked to perform at parties, he always said, "If there's a qeran in it, I'll go." Here the transformation from dilettante to paid showqi is most concisely illustrated. </P><P>
It is not easy to uncover the basic criteria for a master musician's success, but some guidelines can be advanced. The performer is expected to display three basic skills: eclecticism in repertoire, a certain level of instrumental virtuosity, and a good memory. It is on these points that he is judged, rather than on his startling innovations or his elegant style. Let us consider the three items singly. Eclecticism means familiarity with the three basic sources of northern music: non urban folk styles, traditional urban music, and outside music. The last category breaks down into two main groupings: the music of Radio Afghanistan and that of Indian films. (The music of the West has as yet had virtually no influence on the styles of northern Afghanistan -or, for that matter, on any Afghan taste beyond that of a tiny fraction of upper-class Kabulis. ) The musician is free to blend these three wellsprings of creativity in any order and proportion he chooses. Specific mixtures of styles will be discussed later in this chapter. </P><P>
The level of instrumental virtuosity required is hard to define. It does not generally involve a great display of technical prowess; there is, as we shall see, little attempt by instrumentalists to think up and execute prodigious feats of virtuosity on their instruments. Of course, people in northern Afghanistan, like listeners everywhere, are impressed by unusually difficult technical feats, but they do not seem to expect it or stress it as an important feature of good performance. </P>
