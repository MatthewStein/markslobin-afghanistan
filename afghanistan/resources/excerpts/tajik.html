Like many other factors in the great ethnic mix of Afghanistan, the term Tajik itself is ambiguous and somewhat contradictory in origin and application. Browne, in his Literary History of Persia {1951:468), gives the standard etymology of the word concisely: "Tajik, a term originally applied to the Arabs {Tazik, Tazi) who garrisoned the towns of Khurasan and Transoxania, was later and is still applied to the Persian settled population as opposed to the nomads of Turkish stock." Perhaps typical of this vague usage is the fact that the famed Afghan hound is known in Persian as tazi to this day.

Bellew and Elphinstone, writing at different times in the nineteenth century, gave excellent summaries of the use of the term Tajik and of the habits of the Afghan Tajiks. Most of what they said holds true even today. Here is Bellew, writing in 1880 {110): 
</P><blockquote>
Tajik [must] be held to be merely the ancient name for the Persian cultivator or peasant. The word, in fact, being a Persian one, is restricted to the territories which formerly owned the Persian sovereignty. Hence its absence from India, and its presence in Turkistan. The Tajiks extend all over the plain country of Afghanistan, from Herat to the Khybar and from Kandahar to the Oxus, and even into Kashgar. The name is applied nowadays in a very loose way, and is made to include all the Persian-speaking people of the country who are not either Hazarah, Afghan or Sayyid. The term is also applied to the representatives of the ancient Persian inhabitants of Badakhshan and its inaccessible mountain glens. </blockquote><P>
Elphinstone, writing more than forty years earlier, came to much the same conclusion (1839: 403-408): </P><blockquote>
 . . . [The Tajiks] are mixed with the Uzbeks through the greater part of their dominions. In Persia, the plains of Afghanistan and the Uzbek country, they appear to have been settled before the arrival of the nations which are now predominant in those countries. <BR><BR>
The name of Taujik is rather loosely used. It is sometimes applied to all persons mixed with the Toorks or Afghauns who are not sprung from those stocks . . . but it is with more propriety confined to those inhabitants of countries where Toorkee and Pushtoo are spoken, whose vernacular language is Persian. The names of Taujik and Parseewaun are indeed used indiscriminately both in Afghaunistan and Toorkistaun. <BR><BR>
The Taujiks are everywhere remarkable for their use of fixed habitations, and their disposition to agriculture and other settled employments. <BR><BR>
The Taujiks are most numerous about towns. They compose the principal part of the population round Caubul, Candahar, Ghuznee, Heraut and Bulkh, while in wild parts of the country÷ there is scarcely a Taujik to be found. 
 </blockquote><P>
It is remarkable how closely these old descriptions of the place of Tajiks in Afghanistan fit the present-day picture. The only major change since Elphinstone's time is the apparent decrease of Tajiks in Kandahar and Ghazni, where they are hardly as numerous today as they seem to have been in 1839. Both Bellew and Elphinstone showed considerable sensitivity in defining the practical meaning of the term Tajik as it applies throughout Afghanistan today and in much of Soviet Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the recent past. </P><P>
However, when moving beyond these general descriptions to the more precise questions of identifying Tajiks in a given setting, one realizes the full complexity of the "Tajik problem." Many native speakers of Persian are not Tajiks, nor are all Tajiks alike in such basic matters as adherence to the Sunni or Shi'a branches of Islam or use of the same dialect of Persian. Moving around Afghanistan, one encounters a surprising variety of peoples all calling themselves Tajiks. In the Hazarajat, a large body of Shi'a Tajiks lives alongside the allegedly Mongolian Hazaras, their coreligionists. In the Panjshir, north of Kabul, the so-called Kohistani Tajiks seem to have sprung from somewhat different stock. The Tajiks of Turkestan are greatly mixed with Uzbeks and have many Turkic words in their speech, and are Sunni. Those of Badakhshan are largely Shi'a, many of them belonging to the Ismaili sect, and are much less mixed with surrounding populations than are the previously mentioned groups of Tajiks. </P><P>
Farther to the east, the so-called Pamir Tajiks inhabit the "inaccessible mountain glens" referred to by Bellew; they speak very archaic Iranian languages (Yaghnobi, Sanglichi, Sughni, etc.) unintelligible to he other Tajiks of Afghanistan. The town Tajiks of Kabul have a different background; many of them are called Qizilbash and are supposed to have descended from Turkic colonists settled by the Persian conqueror Nadir Shah in the early eighteenth century. The Tajiks of Herat form part of the population of old Khorasan, a part of the Persian Empire from the days of Cyrus the Great. Finally, across the border in the USSR live a large body of Tajiks settled in their own republic, the Tajik SSR; they speak a type of eastern Persian they call Tajik, while their Afghan neighbors speak Farsi, now called Dari by the Afghan government. </P><P>
It is clear that all of these varied groups of Tajiks do not spring from a single source in time or place, and that they represent various strata of settlement within the Iranian world. For the most part, Elphinstone's view that the Tajiks were the first to settle in areas that were later overrun by other Iranian and Turco-Mongol peoples seems sound enough, and it is supported by the presence of small pockets of Tajiks, often speaking archaic dialects, in mountain refuge areas such as the Pamirs. Considerable field work undertaken by Soviet scholars in areas of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan reinforces the view of Tajiks as the old Iranian population of the entire area under discussion in this book, and the present-day differences in beliefs and practices among their various groups must be ascribed to the workings of two or three thousand years of continual flux and turmoil in an area that it often referred to as a major crossroads of Asia. </P><P>
Turning to the Tajiks of Afghan Turkestan, it is very difficult to estimate their proportion in the total population of the area, but an educated guess of perhaps 25-30 percent might not be far from wrong; there are no reliable official figures bearing on this point. For the Saripul region of Turkestan, not an area of Tajik concentration, the Tappers (1973:p.c.) set the Tajik component at 20 percent. Thus the Tajiks form a minority in Turkestan, as they do in many other regions of the country, but they are a sizeable and influential minority in an area where there is no majority group. </P><P>
Sufficient reason for the cultural importance of the Tajiks could be found in the early descriptions of their life quoted above -they formed the backbone of the old peasant population of much of Afghanistan, including Turkestan, and as such they served as models of settled life for the pastoral nomads, principally Uzbeks and Turkmens, who arrived on the scene in recent centuries. However, trade was also traditionally in the hands of the Tajiks, and the position of their language, Persian, as the lingua franca of Turkestan's commerce gave added impetus to Tajik cultural predominance. Even in the city of Bukhara (now in Uzbekistan), which was for centuries the capital of a great Uzbek kingdom, the majority of the population, regardless of ethnic affiliation, spoke Persian, and today, according to Soviet researchers, most Bukharan children still choose to study Tajik (Persian) rather than Uzbek in the public schools (Sukhareva 1966: 124).</P><P>
Tajik primacy manifests itself in many ways. Pierre Centlivres notes that in the town of Tashqurghan in Afghan Turkestan, many Uzbeks call themselves Tajiks and prefer to intermarry into Tajik families (1968: p.c.). It is also significant that a great many Uzbeks of northern Afghanistan refer to all of Soviet Central Asia simply as "Tajikistan." </P><P>
Thus to a great extent Tajiks and Uzbeks have formed a kind of joint culture under Tajik influence in Afghan Turkestan (as well as in Transoxania). Influence does not run only one way, of course: Tajiks have picked up a good many Turkic words and customs as well. We shall discuss Uzbek-Tajik symbiosis at greater length below. </P><P>
Schurmann (1961:73ff.) divides the Tajiks into four basic types: Herati, Afghan Turkestani, seminomadic (north of Bamian), and mountain Tajiks (including Badakhshan and Pamirs); this classification is one with which I tend to agree. The main problem Schurmann runs into is one at which every investigator balks: defining Tajiks between Badakhshan and the region north of Bamian. Schurmann tends to call all of these mountain Tajiks: </P><blockquote>
The region of Mountain Tajik settlement extends from the Western Paropamisus to the Soviet-Chinese Pamirs. The Tajik settlement of Sar-i Mushkan (. . . in the Ghorat) probably forms the southwestern-most extension of Mountain Tajik settlement . . . there are indications that prior to the incursions of Mongoloid nomadic groups, the principal population of both the Badghisat and the Hazarajat was Mountain Tajik (or some form of Iranian population). (1961:77) 
</blockquote><P>In the final parenthetical remark Schurmann begs the question; clearly "some form of Iranian population" is involved, but we remain in the dark as to the history of and links between various types of so-called Tajiks.
