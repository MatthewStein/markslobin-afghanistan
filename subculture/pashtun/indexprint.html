<p class="head1">Pashtuns</p>
        <p> In the minority in the North, Pashtuns sustain their traditional culture 
          in many ways, including song. One fascinating form unique to this people 
          is the landai (also spelled lundai or landey in English), whose form 
          is described this way by the Pashto writer Saduddin Shpoon:ìa non-rhymed 
          two-lined catalectic verse with five anapestic paeon feet, two in the 
          first line and three in the second, ending in MA or NA.î This pithy 
          poem reminds one of the Japanese haiku in its brevity and punch. Here 
          are two typical landai poems as translated by Shpoon: </p>
        <blockquote><p>Golaab che pre she bea raa shin she Zzre che Zakhmi she tol wojood 
          wer sara mrina </p>
        <p>You cut a flower, and another grows, as red, as tender as the first. 
          This is not the way with hearts.</p>
        <p> Pe loyo ghro de Khudaay nazar dai Pe sar-ye waawre warawi chaaper 
          goloona </p>
        <p>God has an affair [literally: an eye] with lofty mountains; With snow 
          he caps them, and around them plants flowers. </p></blockquote>
        <p>Particularly among the nomadic Pashtuns, or kuchi, Shpoon estimates 
          that the overwhelming majority of the landai poems are composed by women, 
          who traditionally worked alongside men, unveiled. </p>
        <p>One of my closest collaborators in trying to understand the music of 
          the North was <a href=javascript:; onClick="popImage('images/image1.jpg','Baba Naim');return false;" class="textlink">Baba Naim</a>, a Pashtun from Badakhshan, in the far-off mountains. 
          He came to Kabul, invited to join the Radio Afghanistan orchestra, where 
          he played the northern fiddle called <a href=javascript:; onClick="popImage('images/image2.jpg','Ghichak');return false;" class="textlink">ghichak</a>. 
          He built a specially beautiful instrument with mother of pearl, sheep-bone, 
          and camel-bone inlay, and arranged to have one made for me, the only 
          examples of this type of instrument. Normally, the ghichak is made from 
          a standardized, multicolored spike with pegs, built in the crossroads 
          city of Tashqurghan, to which you only need to add wire strings, a wooden 
          bridge, and a nail as a prop to rest it on. </p>
        <p>Baba Naim played regularly in the Spinzar Hotel in downtown Kabul for 
          foreign visitors, so appeared on a number of early recordings of Afghan 
          music in the 1960s and 1970s. I enjoyed his discourses on musical style 
          and tapped his broad repertoire, including a set of <a href=javascript:; onClick="popMusic('http://condor.wesleyan.edu/openmedia/mslobin/track06_landai_songs_Pashtun.mp3','Badakhshani Landai Songs','Baba Naim', 'Ghichak','4.8 M','mp3','178','Kabul');return false;" class="textlink">landai songs</a> he 
          offered me. They are personal and unconventional, in terms of mainstream 
          Pashtun practice, showing influence from Badakkhshani practice, and 
          are very beautiful as sung to his plaintive ghichak. </p>
        <p>By contrast, I taped some mainstream, southwestern Afghan music on 
          a short trip to Girishk and Lashkar Gah, beyond the largest Pashtun 
          city, Kandahar. One lively number they allowed me to tape was a <a href=javascript:; onClick="popMusic('http://condor.wesleyan.edu/openmedia/mslobin/track02_Song_for_Attan_Dancing.mp3','Song for Attan Dancing','Pashtun Men', 'Voice','2.8 M','mp3');return false;" class="textlink">song 
          for attan dancing</a>, a pastime of Pashtun men. There are many variants 
          of the attan; estimates go up to thirty. Most of them share the common 
          feature of ring formation, in which all the men revolve in ever-increasing 
          agitation, hair flying to the rhythm. The tempo picks up until the last 
          man sinks to the ground in exhaustion. This recording, made indoors, 
          conveys only a fraction of the excitement that marks the attan, especially 
          since it happens at celebrations such as weddings, often prompting an 
          impromptu burst of enthusiastic gunfire as accompaniment. The text, 
          like many folksongs, references a particular locale, as translated by 
          Mr. Jehani, now working at the Voice of America in Washington, DC: </p>
        <p><blockquote>The girls of Spairwan (a village southwest of Kandahar) are dancing. 
          Their food is the green, sweet grapes, and the morning breeze touches 
          and caresses them. Beautiful girls who wear sandals, you drove the boys 
          crazy, So the other people cannot work and earn their livelihood.</blockquote>
