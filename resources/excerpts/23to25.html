In delineating the shared music culture of northern Afghanistan, it will be useful first to determine what niche music occupies in the general cultural pattern of the area. We shall examine music as part of a broad range of activities defined by northerners as belonging to a single set, and then move on to outline the particular characteristics of musical activity within that larger category. The most common term associated with musical activity is showq , or showqi, a Persian word. Steingass's definition of showq (1970:766) is worth quoting in full, as it conveys some of the nuances implied in the term: ÏFilling with desire; desire, yearning, love; affection, inclination, predi- lection; fancy, pleasure; curiosity; sympathy.Ó 
</P><P>
And for showqi he gives "Loving, amorous; cheerful" (1970:766). In Afghanistan as a whole, showqi is used by Persian speakers to describe a great many activities practiced by individuals for their own pleasure, and it implies the state of mind that leads a person to involve himself in those pursuits. In Afghanistan the adjectival noun form showqi is used for this state, and it may also be applied to musicians as part of a professional name, e.g., Karim Showqi. Different Afghans may provide varying lists of activities that can be included under the rubric of showqi, but there is underlying agreement as to the general scope and connotations of the term. Let us look at a partial list of showqi pursuits gathered from a number of Afghans : </P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Gambling of all sorts ( dice, cards, casting sheep bones ) 
Collecting any sort of object, but particularly such things as weapons Raising, training, and fighting various animals ( quails, partridges, 
roosters, dogs, camels ) 
Collecting snakes, lizards, and scorpions Admiration and raising of flowers 
Kite flying, wrestling, and other sports 
Decorating objects lavishly (radios, musical instruments, cars, trucks, horsecarts, etc. ) 
Patronizing favorite dancing boys or female entertainers Playing a musical instrument as an amateur 
 </BLOCKQUOTE><P>
The thread running through these diverse activities is the inner state that leads the individual to indulge in them. This state is hard to define precisely but involves several of the terms listed by Steingass: pleasure, affection, and predilection seem nearest the mark. Afghans describe showqi as a condition of the dil, or heart, and by and large give the term a positive value. If a person is showqi for something, dilash zende ast ("his heart is lively"), although, as we shall see, an excess of showqi can be harmful. </P><P>
To compare the phenomenon with its counterpart in, say, American culture, showqi embraces the range of pursuits we might classify as pastime, hobby, or avocation, though these terms are a bit weaker than the affective field of showqi. One can perhaps think of a showqi person as falling somewhere between the American "buff' and "nut" ( as in "rifle buff" or "car nut" ) ; the former term seems a bit mild for showqi, while the latter falls into the overzealous range. Thus, showqi lies somewhere in the zone between a hobby and an obsession and can perhabs best be described as a preoccupation with certain objects or activities, but one that does not constitute the individual's principal job or determine his station in life. In the broadest sense, showqi can be used as a general epithet to sum up someone's character, generally in an admiring way: U besiar showqist ("He's very showqi"). The evident implication is that an individual who shows signs of life - of yearning, fancy, and desire -is on the right track. We shall discuss in detail below the ramifications of the term showqi as applied to the musician; for now it will suffice to understand showqi as a broad category that includes music. </P><P>
Music, then, is one of the activities that enlivens life. Yet if this pursuit is carried too far, the bounds of showqi are overstepped and music becomes a potential source of social danger. Perhaps the clearest reflection of this attitude toward music lies in terms applied to certain musicians or used by them to describe their own situation. To call a man a diwaina ("madman"), for example, clearly rules him beyond the pale of normal social behavior; yet this term may be used for particular musicians, even as a form of address. Majnun, the name of the love- mad hero of the old Arabo-Persian tale of Leili and Majnun, is almost a synonym for diwana. Further, a musician may be said to be mast ("drunk") while playing, and the activity itself might be termed masti kardan ("whooping it up"), implying drunkenness. Even the relatively less loaded term awsheq ( also used traditionally in Iran and Azerbaijan for minstrel) literally means "lover" and comes close to majnun in core meaning. All of these epithets connote sowai bevond normal limits. </P><P> 
A further terminological reference to the musician's special state relates to the warmth or heat generated by his performance. The musician himself takes this as a natural part of his life. For example, during a private recording session with Akhmad-Bakhshi, an outstanding Turkmen performer, I asked for a certain song; he declined, saying that the song "takes a great deal of strength," and must come after several more relaxed selections. Midway through the session I offered him some melon to effect a break for interviewing. Akhmad-Bakhshi refused, saying, "Dil-i man garm shud"("My heart [soul] has become hot"); melon, locally classified as a cool food, would have been unsuitable for him at the moment. Pointing to a friend seated next to him, the musician said that he could have some; the friend, himself a musician, had no objection to melon as long as he was not performing. Similarly, a lively performance may be termd porjush ("boiling over") . Such a conception of the internal heat of performers strikes a familiar cultural bell when one recalls terms such as "hot" jazz and "fiery" rendition. For the layman in Afghanistan as in the West, this special ardor of the musician carries vaguely dangerous overtones. </P><P>
In Afghanistan, as elsewhere, the peril lies in disruption of the social balance through loosening of public morals. To understand this possibility fully, we must step back and examine the place of music in Islam, since religion is usually cited as the principal support of morality in Afghanistan. It is generally agreed that while the Qur'an takes no explicit stand against music, the hadith (traditions) surrounding Mohammad's life contain numerous examples of antimusical bias -e.g., calling musical instruments "the devil's muezzin, serving to call men to his worship" (Hitti 1963:274). As Farmer has noted, these hadith "were used with considerable effect by the legists (fuqaha) to forbid any kind of music save that which was known to have been tolerated by the Prophet" (Farmer 1957:427) .However, there was some disagreement among Muslim theorists: "Most Moslem legists and theologians frowned on music; some condemned it in all its aspects; a few looked upon it as religiously unpraiseworthy (makruh), though not actually sinful (haram) ..." (Hitti 1963:274). Farmer notes that while "the four great legal schools of Islam. ..decided, more or less, against 'listening to music,' a most interesting controversial literature on its permissibility or otherwise grew up" (1957:427). Thus it is difficult to generalize about Islamic attitudes towards music; the indi- vidual time and locale must be considered, and even then conflicting views might be unearthed. </P>
