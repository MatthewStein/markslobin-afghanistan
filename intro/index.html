              <P class="head1" >The Fieldwork Project</P>
              <P> In September 1967, I arrived in <a href="javascript:;" onClick="popImage('images/KABUL_AERIAL_1.jpg','Aerial photo showing Kabul in the distance');return false;">Kabul</a>,
                along with <a href="javascript:;" onClick="popImage('images/greta_ondonkey.jpg','Greta Nachteiler Slobin');return false;">Greta
                Nachteiler Slobin</a>, via Europe and Iran. I was a doctoral
                candidate at the University of Michigan, supported by a Foreign
                Area Fellowship (ACLS/SSRC) that had begun in July, and which
                extended through December, 1969, when I finished my dissertation.
                We remained in Afghanistan through the end of November, 1968,
                and returned to the US in March, 1969. This included two trips
                to cities in Soviet Central Asia (now independent countries)
                for a comparative look at the peoples I worked with the most:
                Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Turkmens along the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="popImage('images/AMU_DARYA_AERIAL3_1.jpg','The Amu Darya river - the Soviet Afghan Border','625','400');return false;">Afghan-Soviet
                border</a>. My interest in the musics of the region had been
                sparked by Soviet research on Central Asian musics and encouraged
                by my advisor, William P. Malm. Early readings formed the basis
                for my 1966 M.A. thesis, published in 1969 as Kirgiz Instrumental
                Music. Since no American could do fieldwork in the Asian parts
                of the USSR, I decided to do research among the same peoples
                across the border in Afghanistan. I studied Persian, the most
                commonly-understood language of the country's many tongues. </P>
              <P> After the long fieldwork stint, I returned in 1971 and 1972
                for month-long follow-up trips to clarify and expand the research,
                with an eye towards turning my 1969 dissertation, Instrumental
                Music of Northern Afghanistan (University of Michigan) into a
                more broadly-based monograph. Colin Turnbull, editor of the Viking
                Fund Publications in Anthropology, pushed me to make the work "more
                ethnographic." As the book says, my "initial musicological interest
                moved toward ethnography with consideration of the question of
                music as part of ethnic boundary maintenance." <a href="../resources/index.html"><i>Music
                in the Culture of Northern Afghanistan</i></a> appeared at the
                University of Arizona Press in 1976, staying in print until 2002,
                for which I am most grateful to the Press and to the Wenner-Gren
                Foundation for Anthropological Research, the series sponsor,
                which reverted the rights to me in 2002. </P>
              <P>I have never returned to Afghanistan. My work "temporarily" moved
                off in the direction of the musical heritage of the eastern European
                Jews and general issues of ethnicity and musical identity. Around
                1980, when I completed the first cycle of the Yiddish music work,
                I might well have gone back to Afghanistan, but a vicious and
                tragic cycle of destruction engulfed that country, starting in
                1978, which broke only with the American intervention of 2001. </P></td>

          <tr>
            <td class="text" colspan="2"><P> Afghanistan allowed western researchers
                access only in the early 1960s. In the brief window between then
                and 1978, only three other western scholars did extensive fieldwork
                in music. Hiromi Lorraine Sakata was the first, doing her M.A.
                research (accompanied by Tom Sakata, for the University of Washington)
                in Central Afghanistan in 1966-67 before I arrived. She returned
                for doctoral work, eventually publishing Music in the Mind: The
                Concepts of Music and Musician in Afghanistan in 1983 (2d printing:
                Smithsonian, 2003), and the husband-wife team of John Baily and
                Veronica Doubleday, who focused on the music of the city of Herat
                in the mid-1970s, resulting in Music of Afghanistan: Professional
                Musicians in the City of Herat (Cambridge University Press, 1988)
                and Three Women of Herat (University of Texas Press, 1990) respectively. </P>
              <P> But as of September 1967, virtually nothing useful had been
                written about the musics of Afghanistan in any western language
                (or locally), and only a handful of sparsely- or dubiously-annotated
                recordings had appeared. The many European travelers' accounts
                from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries occasionally
                mentioned music, sometimes informatively, but usually disparagingly.
                I might have benefited from Sakata's fieldwork knowledge, but
                in the days before e-mail, I had no way of contacting her; we
                did not meet until 1971. So I had no idea of what types of musical
                instruments, genres, contexts, and social roles existed anywhere
                in Afghanistan. </P>
              <P> In short, I was doing classic terra incognita research. It
                was normal, even desirable, in 1960s ethnomusicology for a graduate
                student to cover entirely new ground, planting the flag for science,
                to use an imperialist metaphor that was not totally inapt. Afghanistan
                was ideal: music was still local and isolated. </P>
              <P> Roads were terrible through the 1960s, allowing for the survival
                of local or microregional styles. Media exposure to even local,
                let alone world commercial music, was very limited. The one radio
                station in the country, <a href="../sharedmusic/radio.html">Radio
                Afghanistan</a>, had only extended its broadcast range nationwide
                in the 1950s. The main competition in my region, the North, were
                the single, state-controlled stations of the Soviet republics-Turkmenistan,
                Uzbekistan, Tajikistan--and possibly neighboring Iran. A few
                open-reel tape recorders allowed minor circulation of other musics,
                mostly the songs of the Hindi films that were the mainstay of
                the few local cinemas. My fieldnotes from the remote town of
                Andkhoi foreshadowed the impact of audiocassettes in the early
                1970s: "I asked Mowlanqul about taped music blasted over PA systems
                from teahouses. He said the practice started twelve years ago.
                Someone brought a recorder from Kabul and everyone was amazed,
                so everybody got them and it became commonplace. The tapes we
                hear in the hotel are 4-5 years old, showing exactly zero stylistic
                change since then, and he says twelve years ago it was the same." </P>
              <P> At Radio Afghanistan, they asked me to do a program explaining <a href="/afghanistan/cgi-bin/slobinsearch.cgi?searchstring=Beatles">the
                  Beatles</a>, whom people had vaguely heard about but did not
                  understand. Having the only copy in the country of Sergeant
                  Pepper made me an authority, and I overcame my worries about
                  contaminating the music culture I wanted to study; listeners
                  were willing to join the transnational music world without
                  my help. By the time of my last visit, in 1972, young bands
                  of Filipinos, some of whom worked for Americans, were playing
                  rock at the new restaurants like the Marco Polo. This was an "emerging" and "developing," peaceful,
                  stable nation-state operating democratically under a constitutional
                  monarchy and tiptoeing onto the world scene. Foreigners spread
                  across the countryside: French, German, and American Peace
                  Corps units, east German, Czech, Polish, and Dutch technical
                  advisors, UN and USAID colonies, and an Englishman telling
                  Radio Afghanistan how to do standard modern programming. One
                  day, I met John Donne, the advisor, in the radio archives.
                  He was searching for a march so the station could have a proper
                  sports show. </P>
              <P> Afghan musicians, and even most officials, were curious, sometimes
                bemused, and helpful. Traditions of hospitality remained intact
                and the government saw to it that foreigners were as secure as
                possible. The Acknowledgements section of the book lists just
                some of the people who made it possible for me to gather the
                material on this site and to try to understand the many cultures
                of Afghanistan, but there are many more people who explained
                things and shared my love for the folk musics of the country. </P>
              <P class="head1">The Fate of Music</P>
              <P> In 1973, the King, Zahir Shah, was deposed by his brother-in-law
                and rival Daud, who was then assassinated and replaced by a small
                communist clique. When fierce backlash pushed that group to the
                edge of annihilation, the geriatric Soviet leadership decided
                to invade rather than cut its losses, plunging Afghanistan into
                22 years of resistance, civil war among the militias that ousted
                the Soviet army, supported by various foreign powers, the rule
                of the authoritarian Taliban, and an American invention in 2001
                that placed a new western-supported leadership into power, with
                an uncertain future. Through all this time of dark upheaval,
                nearly a majority of the population fled to refugee camps in
                neighboring Iran and Afghanistan. </P>
              <P> Music-making, so strongly tied to celebration, fell to the
                most marginal status. John Baily continued to document its survival,
                most vividly in his well-received ethnographic film Amir: The
                Life of an Afghan Refugee Musician. The film, set in Peshawar,
                Pakistan, recounts how he reconnected with a musician-friend
                from the faraway Afghan city of Herat. Baily also saliently summarized
                the crushing of Afghan music under the heel of the Taliban in
                the period 1996-2001 (Baily 2001), and at the end of 2002, he
                visited Kabul to help with the reconstruction of Afghan musical
                life under the Karzai government. </P>
				<P class="head1" >Update</P>
				<p>Baily’s film <em>A Kabul Music Diary</em> (2003) and a film by Simon Broughton for BBC, <em>Breaking the Silence: Music in Afghanistan</em> (2002), document the early phases of music reconstruction in Afghanistan. More recently, Hiromi Lorraine Sakata, the third early major scholar of Afghan music, has helped to arrange for the digitization of the Radio Afghanistan music archive. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Taliban, but it turned out that the staff managed to save this main treasurehouse of Afghan musical heritage from pre-war times.</p>
				<p>In 2006, a young Turkmen named Noor Mohammad Quyash from the city of Shiberghan contacted me about this website and I asked him to send an update on music there. His initial report is attached as a pdf file, describing the recent revival of celebrations in the <a href="../resources/qizilayaq_update.pdf" target="_blank">town of Qizil Ayaq</a>, where I had done substantial collecting under the aegis of the local spiritual and temporal leader, the Qizil Ayaq Khalifa, in 1968. It would be wonderful to receive more communications like this as the always fluid political, social, and cultural situation of Afghan music evolves.</p>
